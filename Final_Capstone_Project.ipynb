    "We will be focusing on locating those areas of Chicago's western suburbs that have a low density of grocery stores, particularly those with sparse number of medium sized grocery stores such as Aldi. The limit of our analysis will be confined to within an approximate radius of 10 miles from city center which in this case will be the Plainfield Village Hall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step one, is to collect the required data, location of all medium sized grocery stores within 10 miles from the Plainfield Village Hall. Foursquare categorization will be used in identifying medium sized grocery stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step two, determining the population density across the western suburbs. The focus will be to identify some areas close to Plainfield Village Hall with very low density of medium sized grocery stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final step, focusing on the most attractive locations to setup our store. To get to that point we will create clusters of locations based upon feedback from our stakeholders who will be conducting some fact-finding of their own. Locations with no more than two medium sized grocery stores within a radius of 2 miles. Presenting maps of all attractive locations by using k-means clustering in order to identify location details and attributes that will help our stakeholders explore and decide on an optimal venue."
